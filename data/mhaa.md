No love for Android?

Oh well here's what I've been using on my phone to download torrents.

For TV shows:

    - Flud - app client

    - ShowRSS - custom tv shows feed for Flud(auto download)

For Movies:

    - Flud - app client

    - Torrent Search Engine - just a simple app to find torrents.

    or just use whatever torrent sites to download

For cracked Android apps

    - [onhax](https://onhax.me/category/mobile/android/cracked-android-apps) - the site is legit for cracked Android apps but make sure you have adblocker installed cuz the pop ups on that site is mad.

    - [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) - upload the downloaded app to this site to check for any virus and whatnot to be extra careful before installing.

Edit: thanks to nadsaee, gubatron, castaway & others for the amazing recommendations!

    - [Mobilism](http://mobilism.org/) - this shit is so doped! It puts onhax to [shame!](https://media.giphy.com/media/YGtxUpseb0WDS/giphy.gif)

    - [FrostWire](http://frostwire.com/) - a very good alternative to Flud but without the showRSS integration, though it comes with in-built torrent finder that's legitly good! üèÜ

    - [Mobdro](https://www.mobdro.com/) - This is a must app for Android if you're into sports! Even if you don't like sports it's got tons of other streams like movies, tvs, podcasts, news and lots more! üèÜüèÜüèÜ
